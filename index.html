<h2>Dior Pop Smoke</h2>

</p>Traphouse Mob<br/>
Huh, roll another one<br/>
Said I'm never lackin', always pistol packing<br/>
With them automatics, we gon' send him to heaven<br/>
Wait, wait, wait, wait, ayy, ayy, woo (aw, shit), huh?<br/>
Oh, you feelin' sturdy, huh? (You feelin' sturdy, man)<br/>
Let me see somethin'<br/>
Shake it, shake it, shake it<br/></p>

</p>She like the way that I dance<br/>
She like the way that I move<br/>
She like the way that I rock<br/>
She like the way that I woo<br/>
And she let it clap for a nigga<br/>
She let it clap for a nigga<br/>
And she throw it back for a nigga<br/>
Yeah, she throw it back for a nigga<br/></p>

</p>Mike Amiri, Mike Amiri<br/>
Billie Jean, Billie Jean, uh<br/>
Christian Dior, Dior<br/>

When it rains, it pours<br/>
She like the way I rrr<br/></p>

</p>When I walk in the spot, 30 on me<br/>
Buy out the club, niggas know that I'm paid<br/>
Bitch, I'm a thot, get me lit<br/>
I can't fuck with these niggas 'cause niggas is gay<br/></p>

</p>All on my page suckin' dick<br/>
All in my comments and screamin' my name<br/>
While I'm in the club, throwin' them 100s, and 50s, and ones, and ones<br/></p>

</p>Pop Smoke, they know I'm wildin'<br/>
If I'm on the island, I'm snatchin' the cell<br/>
Brody got locked, denied his bail<br/>
Until he free, I'm raisin' hell<br/></p>

</p>Tell my shooters call me FaceTime<br/>
For all the times we had to face time<br/>
Free D-Nice, he doin' state time<br/>
If you need the glizzy, you could take mine<br/></p>

</p>Please don't come out your mouth, you know I'm like that<br/>
I'll make a movie like TNT<br/>
Glock-30 on me, ask who really want it<br/>
I bet I air it like BNB<br/></p>

</p>Nappy Blue wildin' in my section<br/>
And I keep that .38 for the weapon<br/>
Remember when I came home from corrections<br/>
All the bad bitches in my direction<br/></p>

</p>She like the way that I dance<br/>
She like the way that I move<br/>
She like the way that I rock<br/>
She like the way that I woo<br/>
And she let it clap for a nigga<br/>
She let it clap for a nigga<br/>
And she throw it back for a nigga<br/>
Yeah, she throw it back for a nigga<br/></p>
